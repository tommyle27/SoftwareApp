# SoftwareApp
This software application is being created for the Doma Immigration Law firm.

Doma's filing system is organized by client names followed by an 8 character integer number.
The purpose of the 8 character number is to number and orgainze files, as well as to prevent file duplicates in the event of more than one client possessing the same name.

This app creates an 8 character ID made up of integers.
The ID is stored in a shared OneDrive file accessible to all Doma employees.
This allows multiple users to create client files efficiently and smoothly without the event of IDs being duplicated.
